ScalingPipe is a sample of Scala drivers for LingPipe,
the famous Machine Learning Natural Language Processing Library,
developed by Bob Carpenter:

We use LingPipe from Scala and will add generalizable examples
here -- feel free to fork and do the same, then ask us to pull!

We use Maven to install Scala and other dependencies.  
Since LingPipe is not open-source, you need to agree to its license
and then manually install lingpipe jar, with

mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.lingpipe -DartifactId=lingpipe -Dversion=3.8.2 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true -Dfile=lingpipe-3.8.2.jar

We use yamlpom pugin for maven from Dan Brown:
